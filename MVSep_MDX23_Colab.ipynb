        "* Fixed high frequency bleed in vocals\n",
        "* Fixed volume compensation for MDX models\n",
        "* It receives input files from temp Colab disk (open file manager in the left to upload a file), not from GDrive, but you can change it to GDrive by setting /content/drive/MyDrive/input (be aware that the path in some cases is case-sensitive and you must create that folder on your own)\n",
        "* For a bit better quality, chunks_size can be set to 500K for ~2:41-3:46(?) tracks - 500K fails with 5 minute tracks\n",
        "* Replace inference.py by [that](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisrael/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2.1/main/inference.py) one if you still have memory issues with 5 minute tracks and chunk_size set to 300K (open file manager and go to Colab folder) - be aware that it disables Demucs denoiser and increases vocal residues.\n",

        "* Both overlaps set to 0.8 is (still) a good balance between duration and quality, but slower\n",
        "* It will show a lot of warinings and exceptions (e.g. PySoundFile failed, EOFError) frequently, but separation can be successful with these errors (and unsuccessful too, if you set wrong parameters)\n",
        "* Instrum is inverted vocals stem\n",
        "* Instrum2 is the sum of drums+bass+other stems (muddier, smaller SDR)\n",
        "* It doesn't use Demucs denoiser disabled yet, so it's less noisy here than current 2.1 - that fix in 2.1 was introduced after the 2.1 release (fixes problems when no matter what chunks you use, you still get memory errors)\n",
