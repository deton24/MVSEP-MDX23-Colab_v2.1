        "* Chunks currently set to 100000, work with 3:00 track. Decrease it if you run out of memory.\n",
        "* With current settings it takes 35 minutes to separate 3:00 track. For faster separation set both overlaps to 0.8, as it's still good performance/quality parameter (0.96 max tested, with 300K before memory issues).\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "* Don't write file names in the input field below - only folder paths allowed (otherwise it will show just /content/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2.1 error).\n",
        "* Batch processing - all audio files inside provided input folder will be separated.<br>\n",
        "* Not all EOFError errors are critical. Check your output folder after separation first.<br>\n",
        "* [v2.2 final](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jarredou/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2/blob/v2.2/MVSep-MDX23-Colab.ipynb) (with faster optional only 2 stem output) - better SDR, more vocal residues\n",

        "Colab version of MDX23 algorithm from [MVSEP.COM](https://www.mvsep.com) with some tweaks:\n",
        "* Updated with new UVR-MDX': voc_ft & Instr-HQ3 models\n",
        "* Fixed high frequency bleed in vocals\n",
        "* Fixed volume compensation for MDX models\n",
        "* It receives input files from temp Colab disk (open file manager in the left to upload a file), not from GDrive, but you can change it to GDrive by setting /content/drive/MyDrive/input (be aware that the path in some cases is case-sensitive and you must create that folder on your own)\n",
        "* For a bit better quality, chunks_size can be set to 500K for ~2:41-3:58 tracks - 500K fails with 5 minute tracks\n",
        "* Replace inference.py by [that](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisrael/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2.1/main/inference.py) one if you still have memory issues with 5 minute tracks and chunk_size set to 300K (open file manager and go to Colab folder) - be aware that it disables Demucs denoiser and increases vocal residues.\n",
        "* Beta 2.2 1.5.1 [inference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887455924845944873/1129470812580225164/inference_1.5.1_vocft_mod.py) - might be a bit cleaner (denoiser still on).\n",

        "* Beta 2.2 1.5.2 (shifts 0, less muddy) - [inference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GKTShwgVKwyLNLssh2AmLiN5vEwrUPus/view?usp=sharing).\n",
        "* For both overlaps set to 0.95 and 500K chunks it takes 27 minutes to process 3:58 track with shifts 0 set in inference from above.\n",
        "* It will show a lot of warinings and exceptions (e.g. PySoundFile failed, EOFError) frequently, but separation can be successful with these errors (and unsuccessful too, if you set wrong parameters)\n",
        "* Instrum is inverted vocals stem\n",
        "* Instrum2 is the sum of drums+bass+other stems (muddier, smaller SDR)\n",
        "* It doesn't use Demucs denoiser disabled yet, so it's less noisy here than current 2.1 - that fix in 2.1 was introduced after the 2.1 release in 2.0 repo (fixes problems when no matter what chunks you use, you still get memory errors in e.g. Demucs 3/4 step)\n",
